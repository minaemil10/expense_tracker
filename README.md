# Expense Tracker ðŸ’¸
A Flutter-based expense tracker app to monitor spending with custom charts, light/dark theming, and responsive design. This project deepened my expertise in native state management and Flutterâ€™s UI capabilities.

## Key Features
- **Theming**: Global color themes with seamless light/dark mode switching using seed colors.
- **State Management**: Manual `setState` and function parameter passing for robust, lightweight state handling.
- **User Input**: Intuitive input via `BottomSheet` and easy deletion with `Dismissible` widgets.
- **Responsive Design**: Native iOS/Android alert dialogs and responsive layouts for screen orientation.
- **Custom Widgets**: Interactive bar chart visualizing expense categories.
